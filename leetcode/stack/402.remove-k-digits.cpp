 * Testcase Example:  '"1432219"\n3'
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits
 * from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
 * The given num does not contain any leading zero.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
 * Output: "1219"
 * Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219
 * which is the smallest.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: num = "10200", k = 1
 * Output: "200"
 * Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the
 * output must not contain leading zeroes.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: num = "10", k = 2
 * Output: "0"
 * Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with
 * nothing which is 0.

	//this problem is pretty tricky,
	//as the smallest number can be obtained by keep removing the number whose next is

	//fox example: 1432219, 4>3, then remove 4, 3>2, remove 3, 2 > 1, remove 2, 3 numbers 
	//are removed, then the result is 1219
	//a stack is used to keep the final result, but can be emualted by the string result
