 *
 * Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the
 * list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two
 * middle value.
 * For example,
 * 
 * [2,3,4], the median is 3
 * 
 * [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
 * 
 * Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
 * 
 * 
 * void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data
 * structure.
 * double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * addNum(1)
 * addNum(2)
 * findMedian() -> 1.5
 * addNum(3) 
 * findMedian() -> 2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0Â and 100, how would you
 * optimize it?
 * If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how
 * would you optimize it?
