 * A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three
 * elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
 * same.
 * 
 * For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
 * 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
 * 7, 7, 7, 7
 * 3, -1, -5, -9
 * 
 * The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7 
 * 
 * 
 * A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that
 * array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 
 * 
 * A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
 * ‚Å†   A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this
 * means that P + 1 < Q.
 * 
 * The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array
 * A. 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * 
 * return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3,
 * 4] itself.
