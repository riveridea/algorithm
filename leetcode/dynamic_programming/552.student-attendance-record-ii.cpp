 * Hard (34.27%)
 * Total Accepted:    14.9K
 * Total Submissions: 43.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '1'
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance
 * records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may
 * be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
 * 
 * A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following
 * three characters:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 'A' : Absent. 
 * 'L' : Late.
 * ‚Å†'P' : Present. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A'
 * (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 8 
 * Explanation:
 * There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
 * "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
 * Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent
 * times. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The value of n won't exceed 100,000.
