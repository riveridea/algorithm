 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1,1]]'
 *
 * Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
 * (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You
 * may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the
 * same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated
 * or reflected) to equal the other.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00011
 * 00011
 * 
 * Given the above grid map, return 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 11011
 * 10000
 * 00001
 * 11011
 * Given the above grid map, return 3.
 * Notice that:
 * 
 * 11
 * 1
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * ‚Å†1
 * 11
 * 
 * are considered different island shapes, because we do not consider
 * reflection / rotation.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
