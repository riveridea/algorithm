 * Testcase Example:  '[3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]\n[3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]'
 *
 * Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the
 * values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4,
 * 9, 8).
 * 
 * Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is
 * the same.
 * 
 * Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and
 * root2 are leaf-similar.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
