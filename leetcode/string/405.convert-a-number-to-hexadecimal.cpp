 * 
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For
 * negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 * The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is
 * zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first
 * character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
 * integer.
 * You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats
 * the number to hex directly.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input:
 * 26
 * 
 * Output:
 * "1a"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input:
 * -1
 * 
 * Output:
 * "ffffffff"
